Hi, Welcome.

Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a
template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs
it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits
out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache
or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind
GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or
blog right here from GitHub.
